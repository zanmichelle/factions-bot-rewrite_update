# Opened source factions bot

### This is opened sourced factions bot

- Idk really how to do readme's xD
- Bot need a discord.js update
- Mineflayers functions from call backs to promises
- other data handling for sqlite that isnt already handled
- Possibly split in multi files instead of one file - this was used because i used to sell bots, and used client-server system where client was an exe with chrome engine and packed nodemodules to run bots
